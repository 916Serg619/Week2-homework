# Horiseon Refactor
Horiseon, a digital marketing agency, has gieven me the task of refactoring the website's syntax.

# What I Have Contributed

Organized each section of code, mainly with semantic html elements, as well as comments, so that the code could be more legible.  
Added alt attributes to every image for added accessibility.
Organized elements in CSS that share the same property adjustments.
